# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

This application can be used to write, save, and delete notes. It uses an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

* The application frontend was already built, I built the backend to connect the two.

* The following HTML routes were created:

  * GET `/notes` - Returns the `notes.html` file.

  * GET `*` - Returns the `index.html` file

* The application has a `db.json` file on the backend that's used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

* The following API routes were created:

  * GET `/api/notes` - Reads the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

  * POST `/api/notes` - Receives a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.

  * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - Receives a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete.
